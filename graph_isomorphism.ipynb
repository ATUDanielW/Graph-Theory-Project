    "##### The mathematical concept called \"graph isomorphism\" implies the similarity of two graphs.\n",
    "##### If there is a one-to-one and onto mapping between the vertices of two graphs, and the edges connecting the vertices are preserved, then the graphs are said to be isomorphic.\n",
    "##### To put it another way, if two graphs are isomorphic, they have the same structure, meaning they contain the same quantity of vertices, edges, and connections between them.\n",
    "##### The labelling of the vertices is the only distinction between the two graphs.\n",
    "##### The graph isomorphism problem, often known as the isomorphism issue, is a challenging computing problem that asks if two graphs are isomorphic.\n",

    "##### Cryptography, pattern recognition, and computer vision are all uses for graph isomorphism.\n",
    "##### To make judgments or solve problems, it is frequently crucial in these domains to establish whether two graphs are equal."
